Single-threaded CPU approach:
Because N elements would require N additions, the runtime scales as O(N). 

Naive GPU approach:
Because each thread adds up all elements needed for each output array element in parallel, the runtime scales as O(N^2).

Recursive doubling GPU approach:
Because the approach involves log(N) phases, where O(N) additions are performed in parallel during 
each phase, the runtime scales as O(log(N)).
